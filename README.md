This is my first portfolio project, showcasing my journey as a web developer and trader. The website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to present a professional portfolio, the services I offer, and contact details. I am constantly developing my skills and actively working on new projects to expand my expertise.
