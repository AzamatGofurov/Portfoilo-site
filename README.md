# Portfolio Website

This is my first portfolio project, showcasing my journey as a web developer and trader. The website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to present a professional portfolio, the services I offer, and contact details. I am constantly developing my skills and actively working on new projects to expand my expertise.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the website.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and layout, including responsive design with media queries.
- **JavaScript**: Used for interactive elements, such as mobile navigation functionality and animations.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Dynamic Navigation**: The navigation bar toggles on smaller screens for better mobile usability.
- **CSS Animations**: Stylish hover effects on buttons, service cards, and other elements (animations are disabled on mobile devices for better performance).
- **Services and Portfolio**: Includes a list of services provided and a portfolio section showcasing my previous work.
- **Statistics Section**: Displays key metrics like satisfied clients and average rating.
- **Testimonial Section**: Highlights client feedback with star ratings.
